# machine_learning_predicting_heart_disease
Predicting male population heart-disease in South Africa with machine learning

## The dataset : 
SAheart.txt :  n = 462 sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk in the region of the Western Cape, South Africa 
Aim of the work :  predict the value of the “chd” (coronary heart disease) response variable
The parameters : p = 9
- sbp : systolic blood pressure
- tobacco : cumulative tobacco
- ldl : low densiity lipoprotein cholesterol
- adiposity
- famhist : family history of heart disease
- typea	: type-A behavior
- obesity
- alcohol : current alcohol consumption
- age : age at onset

## 5 different models :

We try 5 machine learning models in order to compare the models between them and to choose the best predicting model : 
- Decision Tree model
- Bagging model
- Random Forest model
- AdaBoost model
- Gradient Boosting model

We fit the 5 models and make predictions
